# Gerald the Raccoon

Gerald the Raccoon is an HTML5 Canvas and Javascript dungeon crawler browser game. You are Gerald. You want all the trash.
The farmers don't want you to have the trash. You must murder them all with fireballs and take the trash. Got it? Now lay waste and feast upon that trash!

You can play the game [here](http://kyleludlow.github.io/project_glove).
